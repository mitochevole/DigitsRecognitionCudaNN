# DigitsRecognitionCudaNN

A simple C++/CUDA project for me to understand neural networks.
It is inspired by the book on [neural networks and deep learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) by Michael Nielsen and on the practical excercises of weeks three and four of the [Coursera Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng.


I have never received any proper programming training so the code probably lacks of most best practices. Apologies for that. Hopefully it is simple and clear enough for those who want to understand it.


My main goal was to work on my own on the feedforward and backpropagation algorithms. Therefore, the implementaiton is na√Øve and probably not the most efficient. I am not using any linear algebra or NN cuda libraries.
